# Pragmatik
Not just another CMS, but a API-oriented CMS.

## Why ?

Actually there is a lot of way out there to build a website, using frameworks, CMS, etc... but one of the best way to be free and manage performance in a good way is by using framework, they are good for that, but sometimes to be more efficient we often separate the frontend from the backend by using a REST API and a client build in a frontend client like (angular, react, vue.js, etc), but in this case we can lose **the practical side of CMS** ( pages management, SEO content optimization, etc ) and we tend to rebuild some kind of CMS (but this is another story) all this take time and ressources. **Pragmatik** is there to bring to you the power of a **CMS** and the flexibility of a **Framework** in one package. This is why **Pragmatik**.

## What does it offer ?

* An clean an simple REST API to access content
* A simple but complete content administration panel.
* A set of page component ready to use.
* A simple way to create custom widget.
* **Freedom**

## How does it work ?

* Create pages
* Add content to them
* fetch this content from the REST API 
* Display them as you want, with you client (react, Vue.js, Angular ).
